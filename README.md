Counseling site
This site is for a non-profit designed to help women who have been diagnosed with cancer. The basis of the non-profit is to offer counseling to women with cancer to help them throgh their struggle with the diagnosis and to offer them someone to talk to about their pain. While offering counseling to women, the counseling center also offers the ability to connect women with other resources such as companies that offer financial assistance, hair care, transportation and house cleaning needs. We also offer resources in the form of books and manual tools to help during their time of need. 
The website includes css slidein animation on the Biblical Counseling and Resources pages. 
Javascript is included on the hamburger button to display the navigation list.
The css includes media query to display on small, medium and large screens. 
The images and text are responsive.
I added in some css animations on the counseling and resources pages.
The site has been updated to include a form to receive customer feedback on the site and the information is being stored in the upload file. 
There are three graphs on the resource page to show survival rates for breast, ovarian and colon cancer.
On the home page there is a countdown timer to the Flying Pig Marathon which is a marathon to raise money for charities.
